#[link-time]
// importing this would copy yhe code but break it down with ast parsing to only
// forward decls and compile this seprately linking it at compile, this would speed up the build process after first time
// since once a lib is generated it gets injected with last modified times, and only if this file changes does it get recompiled
// this alone makes these kind of imports better then rust
