/* The Vial file format is as described:
- The file is a binary file
- the file starts with a magic number and a version number
- the file is divided into 3 main sections: the manifest, the data, and the symbol table
- the manifest is a list of key-value pairs that describe the data
- the data contains all the files that are part of the compilation unit
- the symbol table contains all the symbols that are part of the compilation unit
- having the data and the symbol table separate allows for caching and incremental compilation
    @brief having a separate symbol table allows for the following:
           each compile with an import to a vile would be parsed and instead of recompiling the vile
           only the symbol table would be updated and after the first compile of the vile each
           subsequent compile would only need to update the symbol table
