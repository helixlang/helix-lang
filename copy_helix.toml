# --- Transpiler Configurations ---
# Detailed settings for the code transpiler.
# target: Specifies the target language for transpilation. Options: 'py', 'c++', etc.
# warnings: Toggles the display of warnings during transpilation.
# verbose: Enables verbose output for detailed logs.
# threads: Defines the number of threads to use for transpilation.
# optimization: Sets the level of optimization. Ranges from 0 (none) to 3 (maximum).
# regex_module: Chooses the regex module to be used. Options: 're', 're2'.

# --- Compiler Configurations ---
# Configurations for various compilers used in the project.
# py: Python layer options: 'py' (default), 'bin', 'vile'.
#     'py' is typical for development and testing.
#     'bin' compiles to a binary executable for production.
#     'vile' generates an ABI for use with other languages and as a Helix library.
# c, cpp, rust: Specify the compilers for C, C++, and Rust respectively.
#     Defaults: 'gcc' for C, 'g++' for C++, 'rustc' for Rust.
# flags_py, flags_cpp, flags_c, flags_rust: Custom flags for compiling Python, C++, C, and Rust.
