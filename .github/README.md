## Error Reporting
Helix is designed with developer productivity in mind, featuring a sophisticated error reporting system that clearly communicates issues to help you quickly understand and address coding errors. The system is built to be intuitive, providing not only the error messages but also actionable suggestions and detailed notes to enhance your debugging process.

### Intuitive and Helpful

<div>
  <img src="../assets/error-ex.png" width="50%" align="right" alt="Error Reporting">
</div>

- **Clear Error Messages**: Helix's error messages are concise and informative, pinpointing the exact issue in your code.
- **Actionable Suggestions**: The error system optionally provides suggestions on how to resolve the issue, guiding you towards a solution.
- **Error Codes**: Error message's have unique codes that can be found in [Helix's documentation](https://helix-lang.com/docs/errors).

---

## Familiarity to C++
Helix is designed with a nod to C++ developers, blending familiar syntax and paradigms with modern language features. This approach reduces the learning curve for those accustomed to C++ and enhances interoperability with existing C++ codebases.

### Code Comparison between Helix and C++

<div>
  <img src="../assets/cxx-like-helix-ex.png" width="48%" alt="Helix Example", align="left">
  <img src="../assets/cxx-like-cxx-ex.png" width="52%" alt="C++ Example", align="right">
  <img src="../assets/bumper.png", width="100%" alt="Bumper">
</div>


- **Template and Class Syntax**: Both Helix and C++ use template mechanisms to enable generic programming. Helix’s `requires` keyword functions similarly to C++ templates, but with a more readable syntax. For instance, where C++ uses `<typename T>`, Helix uses `requires <T>` to declare generic types.
- **Function and Method Definitions**: Helix mirrors C++ in how functions and methods are defined and used, maintaining the same logic flow but simplifying syntax to increase clarity and reduce common pitfalls.
- **Memory Management**: Helix adopts smart pointer concepts similar to C++'s `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` but integrates them more deeply into the language runtime to automate memory safety without manual intervention.
- **Object-Oriented Features**: Like C++, Helix supports classes with member functions, encapsulation, and inheritance. The Helix class structure is streamlined to provide clear and concise object-oriented capabilities without the often verbose syntax found in C++.
- **Concepts and Interfaces**: Helix has a concept system (`interface`) that is similar to C++'s concepts, but with a more straightforward syntax. Interfaces in Helix are similar to C++'s pure virtual classes, providing a way to define abstract types and enforce contracts. While not having the same level of complexity as C++ or the performance overhead, Helix's `interface` keyword provides a simple way to define abstract types.

### Enhancing Developer Experience
By drawing on the strengths of C++ and addressing its complexities, Helix aims to offer an improved developer experience:

- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Helix enhances the error handling model by providing more descriptive and actionable error messages, making debugging faster and more intuitive.
- **Performance**: While retaining the performance characteristics of C++, Helix simplifies memory management and type safety, reducing runtime errors and increasing code reliability.

These examples and features illustrate Helix’s commitment to providing a familiar yet enhanced programming environment for C++ developers, ensuring that they can leverage their existing skills while enjoying the benefits of modern language constructs.

---

## Native Interoperability with C++
Helix has seamless integration with C++ codebases, enabling developers to utilize existing C++ libraries and frameworks effortlessly. This native interoperability is achieved through Helix's robust Foreign Function Interface (FFI), which facilitates smooth communication and data exchange between Helix and C++ code.

### Effortless Integration with Existing C++ Code
Helix's FFI system is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, minimizing the learning curve and allowing for quick adoption in projects that already rely on C++:

<div>
  <img src="../assets/interoperability-with-cxx-hh.png" width="44%" alt="Helix Implementing C++", align="left">
  <img src="../assets/interoperability-with-cxx-helix.png" width="56%" alt="C++ Header", align="right">
  <img src="../assets/bumper.png", width="100%" alt="Bumper">
</div>

- **Simplified Code Sharing**: Developers can easily call C++ functions from Helix and vice versa, leveraging the strength of both languages in a single project. This integration supports complex data types and custom classes, ensuring that you can continue using your refined C++ code within Helix without extensive modifications.
- **Header File Integration**: Helix allows for the direct inclusion of C++ header files, which means you can use C++ classes and templates directly in Helix code. This is particularly useful for projects where maintaining performance-critical sections in C++ is essential.
- **Declarations Septate From Implementations**: Helix's native interoperability with C++ allows for C++ native declarations style, allowing for a more familiar and seamless integration with C++ codebases. Where If you have a C++ class defined in a C++ header file, you can include the header file in Helix and use the class as if it were a Helix class. (See the example above)

### Extending to Other Languages
Beyond C++, Helix's FFI system is designed to be expandable, providing potential pathways to interface with other popular programming languages such as Python, Java, and Rust. This versatility makes Helix an ideal choice for multi-language environments, where different parts of a project may benefit from specific language features.

### Advantages of Using Helix with C++

- **Performance and Safety**: Combine the performance benefits of C++ with the safety features of Helix, such as managed memory and advanced error handling.
- **Code Reusability**: Integrate and reuse existing C++ libraries in new Helix projects, preserving investment in existing codebases while upgrading to newer technology.
- **Flexibility**: Helix's compatibility with C++ offers flexibility in gradually transitioning projects from C++ to Helix, or simply using the best tool for each specific task within a single project.

By providing a seamless bridge between Helix and C++, developers can leverage the strengths of both languages to create robust, high-performance applications with enhanced safety features and streamlined development workflows.

---

## Why Not Rust or Zig?

While both Rust and Zig are excellent languages, they come with certain trade-offs that Helix seeks to address:
- **Lack of OOP Support:** Both Rust and Zig lack comprehensive OOP support, which is essential for certain domains like AI or game development.
- **Strict Safety Mechanisms (Rust):** While Rust's borrow checker is a powerful tool, it can sometimes be too strict, leading to complex refactoring for developers.
- **Limited Features (Zig):** Zig, while performant, lacks certain features like a macro processor that Helix provides.

### Helix: The Best of Both Worlds

Helix draws inspirations from a variety of languages, combining the best features, to create a language that is both powerful and easy to use.
- **Balanced Safety:** Helix features a borrow checker, but with a less strict enforcement, offering flexibility without sacrificing safety.
- **Simpler Syntax:** Helix provides a modern, Python-like syntax, reducing verbosity while maintaining power.
- **OOP Support:** Helix fully supports object-oriented programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** Helix also has support for zero-cost abstractions, allowing for high-level programming (including generics, interfaces, and more) without sacrificing performance.

## Advanced Type System
Helix boasts a robust and flexible type system designed to enhance both safety and developer productivity. It introduces several modern features that ensure code is not only safe but also clear and maintainable.

### Key Aspects of Helix's Type System
- **Non-Nullable Types by Default**: In Helix, all types are non-nullable by default, significantly reducing the risk of null-pointer errors. Helix uses a novel approach to nullable types - [Questionable Types](https://www.helix-lang.com/docs/language/questionable/), which allows for more explicit handling of null or panicking values.
- **Flexible Pointer and Reference Handling**: Helix supports both unsafe pointers and safe pointers, allowing developers to choose the level of safety they need for their code. This flexibility enables fine-grained control over memory management while maintaining safety.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Helix's [error handling](https://www.helix-lang.com/docs/language/panicking/) system is novel to helix, it allows for either complete error handling or a more pythonic approach to error handling, this allows for more control over how errors are handled in Helix.
- **Generics with Advanced Constraints**: The language supports generics with advanced constraints, while maintaining a simple syntax and having zero performance overhead to the binary.

### Example Code Illustration
Here’s a glimpse of Helix's type system in action, demonstrating how these features are applied in real code scenarios:

<div>
  <img src="../assets/type-system-ex.png" width="55%" align="right" alt="Type System Example">
</div>

- **Use of Structs and Classes**: Helix allows the definition of structs and classes with rich features such as operator overloading, nested types, and destructors. This facilitates both simple data storage and complex object-oriented programming.

- **Managed Pointers and Error Handling**: The example code demonstrates managed pointers, error handling, and the use of custom memory allocation strategies. It highlights how Helix handles out-of-bounds access attempts and other common programming errors gracefully.

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety**: The type system in Helix minimizes common errors like null dereferences and memory leaks, making applications safer by default.
- **Increased Productivity**: By reducing boilerplate and automating routine tasks, Helix's type system lets developers focus more on business logic and less on preventing trivial bugs.
- **Greater Flexibility**: Offering a mix of strict and flexible type handling options, Helix caters to a wide range of programming styles and requirements, making it suitable for everything from small scripts to large-scale enterprise applications.

## Extending Functionality with Generics and Inheritance

Helix's type system supports advanced features like generics and inheritance, enabling developers to write more flexible and reusable code. The `BinaryTreeNode` example illustrates how Helix allows for extending classes to specialize behavior for certain types.

### Extending `BinaryTreeNode` for Numerical Types

In Helix, extending any class to add or specialize methods for specific types is straightforward. This capability is particularly useful when working with data structures that need to handle different data types uniquely.

<div>
  <img src="../assets/extends-ex.png" width="55%" align="right" alt="Extending BinaryTreeNode Example">
</div>

- **Generic Base Class**: The `BinaryTreeNode` class is defined generically, allowing it to work with any type `T`. However, by default, it does not implement any specific behavior, such as insertion or search, leaving these methods unimplemented.
- **Specialized Extension**: For numerical types, the class is extended to implement these methods. The extended class checks if `T` implements the `NumericalObject` interface, which includes types like integers and floats. This check ensures that the methods such as `insert` and `find` are only compiled and available if `T` is a numerical type, thus maintaining type safety and efficiency.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Insertion**: The `insert` method adds a value to the binary tree following the standard binary search tree rules. If the tree does not have an appropriate child node to traverse to, it dynamically allocates a new node using Helix's memory management capabilities.
  - **Search**: The `find` method searches for a value, returning `true` if found and `false` otherwise. It traverses the tree based on the value comparisons.

## AMT: Advanced Memory Tracking

Helix introduces a novel approach to borrow checking that diverges significantly from the strict model employed by languages like Rust. Instead of relying on lifetimes and compile-time error enforcement for managing memory and borrow states, Helix adopts a more flexible system designed for both safety and performance.

### Key Features of Helix's AMT System:
- **Managed Pointer Conversions**: In Helix, when a borrow operation violates conventional lifetime rules (as Helix does not use explicit lifetimes), the language automatically converts the standard references into smart pointers. This conversion depends on the context of the borrow:
  - **Shared Managed Pointers**: If a borrow is detected being used across multiple functions or threads where ownership needs to be shared, it is converted into a shared managed pointer, allowing multiple references to the object while ensuring memory safety. This is similar to C++'s `shared_ptr`.
  - **Sole Managed Pointers**: When an object is passed around with clear ownership (i.e., no shared ownership is detected), it becomes a sole managed pointer, ensuring that the object is owned by a single context at any given time. This is similar to C++'s `unique_ptr`.
  - **Conversion Trigger**: Pointers only get converted when necessary, both `Shared Managed Pointer` and `Sole Managed Pointer` only get converted when a borrow checker warning is issued, otherwise, the Helix compiler manages memory at compile time, inserting the necessary checks, optimizations, and memory management code.


- **Warning Instead of Erroring**: Unlike Rust, which will stop compilation when a borrow checker error is detected, Helix issues warnings. These warnings inform the developer of potential sub-optimal memory management practices, such as:
  - **Multiple References Passed**: This warning indicates that an object is being referenced by multiple owners or contexts, suggesting a review of the ownership model to ensure intentional design.
  - **Borrow Outside of Lifetime**: This warning signals that a reference may outlive the scope it was originally confined to, hinting at unintended long-lived references or potential memory safety concerns.

- **Performance Considerations**: Helix's method allows the code to compile and run even when potential borrow checker warnings are emitted, operating in a slightly degraded performance mode due to the overhead introduced by smart pointers. This system ensures that development can continue without immediate hard stops, allowing a broader range of functionality and optimization during later stages of development.
- **Manual Memory Management**: For developers who require more control over memory management, Helix provides the option to bypass the borrow checker and manage memory manually. This feature is particularly useful for performance-critical code where the developer is confident in their memory management skills.
