# Certificates Directory

This directory contains the `entitlements.plist` file used for self code-signing on macOS.

## Self Code-Signing

The Helix compiler has been self-signed because me (the developer) cannot afford a code-signing certificate due to being a broke ass collage student. If you prefer, you can compile the compiler from source.

### How to Compile from Source

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/helix-lang.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd helix-lang
    ```

3. Follow the build instructions provided in the main `README.md` file.

Thank you for using Helix!
