# Helix Programming Language

Helix is an experimental language designed for seamless interoperability with Python, C, C++, and Rust. The project aims to provide developers with a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use language that can leverage the power of existing code and libraries in these languages. With its clean syntax and robust features, Helix aims to simplify the process of writing and maintaining code while maximizing performance.

### Why Helix?

- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, making it ideal for critical applications and systems programming.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrates with C++, Rust, and Python, allowing you to leverage existing codebases.
- **Productivity**: Advanced tooling, including a robust standard library, package manager, and build system.
- **Safety**: Strong type system and error handling to catch bugs at compile-time and runtime.

### Features

- **Concurrent Programming**: Easy-to-use async/await syntax for concurrent tasks.
- **Pattern Matching**: Powerful pattern matching for more readable and maintainable code.
- **Macros and Pre-Processors**: Extensible macros and pre-processors for code generation and optimization.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Extensive libraries to handle various programming tasks out of the box.

### Quick Start

#### Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Helix is currently under development and does not yet have a useable compiler. The following instructions are for development and building the compiler itself.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Build instructions is only tested on 1 machine and may not work for you. Please adjust as needed.

  1. Install the required dependencies (homebrew is required):
      ```bash
      brew install cmake ninja wget xmake
      cd ~
      mkdir -p ~/built-includes/llvm-install
      cd ~/built-includes/llvm-install
      wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-18.1.6/llvm-project-18.1.6.src.tar.xz
      tar -xvf llvm-project-18.1.6.src.tar.xz
      cd llvm-project-18.1.6.src
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -G "Ninja" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi;libunwind" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AArch64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/llvm-aarch64 ../llvm
      ninja
      sudo ninja install
      ```
  2. Clone the Helix repository:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/kneorain/helix-lang.git
      ```
  3. Prepare the build:
      ```bash
      cd helix-lang
      xmake f -p macosx -a arm64 --sdk=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm
      ```
  4. Build the compiler:
      ```bash
      xmake
      ```
  5. Run the compiler:
      ```bash
      ./build/macosx/arm64/release/helix-lang
      ```

### Hello, World!

Here's how you can write and run a simple "Hello, World!" program in Helix:

```rs
fn main() {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```

To compile then run the source:

```bash
helix hello_world.hlx
./hello_world
```

## Getting Started with Helix
##### Variables and Types
Helix supports strong typing and flexible variable declarations:
