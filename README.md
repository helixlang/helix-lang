## Introduction
Helix is an experimental language that is designed to interop with Python, C, C++, and Rust. The goal of the project is to create a language that is easy to use, fast, and efficient. The language will be designed to have a simple syntax, and will be able to easily call functions from other languages.
#### Fast and works with Python, C, C++, and Rust
- Helix is a high-performance language designed for seamless interoperability with Python, C, C++, and Rust, enabling developers to write efficient code and easily call functions from other languages.
- Works with existing code and libraries in Python, C, C++, and Rust, allowing developers to leverage the power of these languages while taking advantage of Helix's simplicity and ease of use.
- Helix is designed to be fast and efficient, with a simple syntax that makes it easy to write and maintain code. It is also designed to be easy to learn, with a focus on readability and simplicity.
